Coding: Input a single-digit number and check whether the number is an Automorphic number or not. Render output on the page.
An automorphic number is a number whose square "ends" in the same digits as the number itself.
For example,
52 = 25, here 25 ends with ‘5’. Display :"5 is an Automorphic Number" on the screen
62 = 36, here 36 ends with ‘6’
So 5 and 6 are automorphic numbers

7 isn't an automorphic number because 7**2=49.Display :"7 is not an Automorphic Number" on the screen
